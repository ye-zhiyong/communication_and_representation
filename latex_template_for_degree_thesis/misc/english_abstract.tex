Road crack detection is an important part of highway maintenance and driving safety.
Up to now, the road crack detection system still has the following problems: 
1) The models are getting bigger and bigger, which reduces the detection speed and efficiency.
2) Most models are deployed in the cloud, which has problems such as communication delay, low efficiency, instability, and overload of the central server.

Aiming at the dual requirements of accuracy and speed in crack detection engineering applications, this paper designs and implements a crack detection system based on edge intelligence based on U-Net convolutional network and its end-side deployment.
The research contents are as follows:
1) Design and implement a detection algorithm based on U-Net convolutional network, and use data augmentation technology to complete model parameter training, effectively improving the detection accuracy. 
Experiments show that the F1 score is improved to about 0.93 after data augmentation, verifying the effectiveness of the algorithm for crack detection.
2) Based on the trained U-Net model, the model parameter quantization from float32 bits to int8 bits is realized, the model size is reduced to 1/4 of the original, and the inference speed is improved. 
Experimental results show that the cosine similarity of the inference results before and after model quantization exceeds 0.99, and the accuracy loss is minimal.
3) Based on the quantized U-Net model, the model deployment and real-time detection of crack are completed on the low-cost, low-power edge chip Hi3516DV300.
System performance testing shows that the crack detection function is normal and the inference speed is close to 0.5 seconds per frame, achieving a good balance between accuracy and speed, verifying the feasibility of deploying the crack detection algorithm on the edge system.

This edge intelligent crack detection system not only effectively avoids communication delay and improves stability;
but also effectively reduces the burden on the central server and reduces the system cost, providing a reference for the industrial application of crack detection.
